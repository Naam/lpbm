Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Nothing in this FAQ was actually asked, but it may help some people to have
these answers. Anyway you can still ask if you think should be added here.

How is lpbm licensed?
---------------------

lpbm is licensed under ``New BSD License``. You can read its whole source
code, copy it for your own projects and even contribute to it. Have fun!

I found a bug, what do I do?
----------------------------

You can go directly where lpbm is developed and fill a bug report in the bug
tracker. Make sure to precise any important information. The more your bug
report is detailed, and the more I will be efficient at solving it.

How are patches accepted?
-------------------------

Firstly thank you for considering patching lpbm! I think there is mostly two
cases here: either you want to solve a bug or add a feature.

In the first case, do not hesitate. You can take any bug present on the bug
tracker to try and solve it. I think the more efficient way to do it is to say
that you're taking it. It isn't a commitment to the task, you can obviously say
that you don't have time anymore/don't want to fix it anymore. Nobody
will/should blame you. But with this work-flow, nobody should work on the same
bug as you if there is something else to do.

If you want to add a feature, we need to discuss it before. I am pretty open to
new features, but I don't want lpbm to become a mess. Obviously you can still
fork and work on that feature on your own, but I can't promise that every
feature will be put upstream. To discuss it, you can either contact me in
private or fill a feature request.

Finally, I will review all your code. If you never did code review, just keep
one thing in mind: if I comment something, it's not because I think your code
or you are bad, I just want lpbm to have a good code base. Obviously you can
argue and comment the current code (that is not reviewed since I am alone...).
